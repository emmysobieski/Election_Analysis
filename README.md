Election Analysis Challenge

For Election Results, I calculated the total number of votes, determined the number of votes that were cast from each county and the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election. Then, I determine which county had the largest turnout, which was Denver. 

I calculated the total percentage of votes and total number of votes that each candidate won.  Then I showed the individual statistics of total votes and percentage of votes for the winner, Diana DeGette.

The Text file final output is below (and in the election_analysis.txt file uploaded):
